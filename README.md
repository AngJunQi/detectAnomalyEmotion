## Project Description
Detecting users anomalous emotions

This project is adopting transfer learning method in machine learning which is the combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning. This project is
completed through the CRISP-DM life cycle. The data will be crawled from Twitter, processed into a clean dataset, and split into training and testing sets in varying 
ratios. Subsequently, the training sets will be utilized to train the model while the testing sets will be used to evaluate the performance of the model. The whole 
project was done by Ang JunQi solely.

## Installation
The source codes had included all the dependencies needed to run the program. All you need after you install all the files is a platform for you to run Python codes
for example Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator which you can download online or Google Collab which is a online platform for you to run Python codes.

## Usage
The file with the name Flask app.ipynb is the file that will start a local server and it will provides a URL once the server is start. The URL will bring you to the
